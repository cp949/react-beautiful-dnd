## Fork history

This package descends from a chain of forks:

1. [`react-beautiful-dnd`](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) — the
   original project, created by Alex Reardon at Atlassian. No longer maintained.
2. [`@hello-pangea/dnd`](https://github.com/hello-pangea/dnd) — community fork of
   (1), continuing maintenance after Atlassian stepped back.
3. `@cp949/react-beautiful-dnd` (this package) — fork of (2).

### What changed in this fork

- **Build**: replaced the Rollup + Babel build with
  [`tsdown`](https://github.com/rolldown/tsdown) (esbuild/rolldown-based). The
  published `dist` no longer contains `@babel/runtime` helpers or
  `regenerator-runtime` — consumers do not need `@babel/runtime` as a dependency.
  The legacy UMD bundle (`dnd.js`, `dnd.min.js`) was dropped; only ESM and CJS
  are published.
- **Browser target**: dropped ES5 support. The build target is Chrome 75 —
  see [Browser support](/docs/about/browser-support.md).
- **Package**: renamed to `@cp949/react-beautiful-dnd`; `dist` file names changed
  from `dnd.*` to `react-beautiful-dnd.*` to match. `peerDependencies` now allow
  React 19 (`^18.0.0 || ^19.0.0`).
- **Tooling**: migrated from ESLint 8 + `eslint-config-airbnb` (unmaintained
  since 2021, incompatible with ESLint 9+) to ESLint 9 flat config.
- **Security**: `pnpm audit` findings reduced from 168 to 0 by upgrading
  `express`, `webpack`, `cypress`, `lighthouse`, and adjusting `pnpm.overrides`
  for transitive dependencies with no direct upgrade path.
- **Dependencies**: removed `markdown-it`, `lodash.isequal`, `fs-extra`, and
  `fast-glob` from `devDependencies` — each had exactly one call site, replaced
  with Node's built-in `fs/promises` APIs or a small inlined implementation.

## Core characteristics

- Beautiful and [natural movement](/docs/about/animations.md) of items 💐
- [Accessible](/docs/about/accessibility.md): powerful keyboard and screen reader support ♿️
- [Extremely performant](/docs/support/media.md) 🚀
- Clean and powerful api which is simple to get started with
- Plays extremely well with standard browser interactions
- [Unopinionated styling](/docs/guides/preset-styles.md)
- No creation of additional wrapper dom nodes - flexbox and focus management friendly!

## Get started 👩‍🏫

Alex Reardon has created [a free course on `egghead.io` 🥚](https://egghead.io/courses/beautiful-and-accessible-drag-and-drop-with-react-beautiful-dnd) (using [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd)) to help you get started with `@cp949/react-beautiful-dnd` as quickly as possible.

- Multiple independent lists on the one page
- Flexible item sizes - the draggable items can have different heights (vertical lists) or widths (horizontal lists)
- [Add and remove items during a drag](/docs/guides/changes-while-dragging.md)
- Compatible with semantic `<table>` reordering - [table pattern](/docs/patterns/tables.md)
- [Auto scrolling](/docs/guides/auto-scrolling.md) - automatically scroll containers and the window as required during a drag (even with keyboard 🔥)
- Custom drag handles - you can drag a whole item by just a part of it
- Able to move the dragging item to another element while dragging (clone, portal) - [Reparenting your `<Draggable />`](/docs/guides/reparenting.md)
- [Create scripted drag and drop experiences 🎮](/docs/sensors/sensor-api.md)

- Server side rendering (SSR) compatible
- Plays well with [nested interactive elements](/docs/api/draggable.md#interactive-child-elements-within-a-draggable-) by default

## Motivation 🤔

`@cp949/react-beautiful-dnd` exists to create beautiful drag and drop for lists that anyone can use - even people who cannot see. For a good overview of the history and motivations of the project you can take a look at these external resources:

- 📖 [Rethinking drag and drop](https://medium.com/@alexandereardon/rethinking-drag-and-drop-d9f5770b4e6b)
- 🎧 [React podcast: fast, accessible and beautiful drag and drop](https://reactpodcast.simplecast.fm/17)

## Not for everyone ✌️

There are a lot of libraries out there that allow for drag and drop interactions within React. Most notable of these is the amazing [`react-dnd`](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd). It does an incredible job at providing a great set of drag and drop primitives which work especially well with the [wildly inconsistent](https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/09/the_html5_drag.html) html5 drag and drop feature. `@cp949/react-beautiful-dnd` is a higher level abstraction specifically built for lists (vertical, horizontal, movement between lists, nested lists and so on). Within that subset of functionality `@cp949/react-beautiful-dnd` offers a powerful, natural and beautiful drag and drop experience. However, it does not provide the breadth of functionality offered by `react-dnd`. One shortcoming is that grid layouts are not supported (yet). So `@cp949/react-beautiful-dnd` might not be for you depending on what your use case is.
